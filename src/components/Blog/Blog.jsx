                <h2>1. When should you use Context API?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Context API in React is a powerful tool for managing state that needs to be accessed by multiple components at different levels in the component tree. Here are some scenarios where using the Context API is beneficial:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Global State Management: When you have state that is relevant to a large portion of your application and you want to avoid prop drilling (passing props through many layers of components).</li>
                    <li>Theming: If your application has a theme that needs to be accessed by various components without explicitly passing it down through props.</li>
                    <li>Authentication: Storing and managing authentication status or user information that needs to be available throughout the application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In these cases, using the Context API can simplify your component structure and improve code maintainability.

            {/* Question 2: What is a Custom Hook? */}
            <section>
                <h2>2. What is a Custom Hook?</h2>
                <p>
                    A custom hook is a JavaScript function that utilizes React hooks (like useState, useEffect, etc.) to encapsulate and reuse logic in a React component. Custom hooks promote code reuse, separation of concerns, and cleaner component code. Some common use cases for custom hooks include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fetching Data: Creating a custom hook to handle data fetching logic, making it easy to reuse across different components.</li>
                    <li>State Management: If you find yourself duplicating state logic in multiple components, consider extracting it into a custom hook.</li>
                    <li>Event Handlers: Abstracting complex event handling logic into a custom hook for cleaner and more maintainable code.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Custom hooks enhance the reusability and readability of your code, making it a valuable pattern in React development.

                <h2>3. What is useRef?</h2>
                <p>
                 useRef  is a hook in React that returns a mutable object called a ref object. This object has a current property, which can be used to hold a reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders. Common use cases for useRef  include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accessing and Modifying DOM Elements: You can use useRef  to get a reference to a DOM element and interact with it directly.</li>
                    <li>Preserving Values Between Renders: useRef  allows you to store values that persist between renders without causing a re-render when the value changes.</li>
                    <li>Creating Mutable Objects: useRef  can be used to create mutable objects that persist throughout the component's lifecycle.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>4. What is useMemo?</h2>
                <p>
                 useMemo is another React hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the result of a computation. It is particularly useful when dealing with expensive calculations or when preventing unnecessary renders. Here are some scenarios where useMemo is beneficial:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expensive Computations: If a component renders frequently and involves computationally expensive operations, using useMemo can memoize the result and prevent unnecessary recalculations.</li>
                    <li>Preventing Unnecessary Renders: Memoizing values with useMemo can prevent a component from re-rendering if the dependencies have not changed, optimizing the overall performance of your application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Understanding when and how to use useMemo is crucial for optimizing your React applications, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex calculations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, mastering these React concepts – the Context API, custom hooks, useRef , and useMemo – can greatly enhance your ability to build efficient, scalable, and maintainable React applications. Each concept serves a specific purpose, and incorporating them into your development toolkit can lead to more robust and performant code.
